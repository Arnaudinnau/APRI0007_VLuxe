# APRI0007 VLuxe
![Logo](/Images/logo_png.png)
This repository contains the [embedded software](https://github.com/Arnaudinnau/APRI0007_VLuxe/blob/main/V_Luxe_Code.asm) developed for the V-Luxe project. The software is written entirely in assembly language for the PIC18F4331 microcontroller.  
Demonstration videos validating the systemâ€™s functionality and complete project report are also included in this repository.

## Video descriptions
### [Video 1 - Automatic Window Opening (Humidity)](https://github.com/Arnaudinnau/APRI0007_VLuxe/blob/main/Videos/1.mp4)
This video demonstrates the automatic opening of the window in response to increased indoor relative humidity.

### [Video 2 - Blind Control System](https://github.com/Arnaudinnau/APRI0007_VLuxe/blob/main/Videos/2.mp4)
This video illustrates the blind control system in action. When external disturbances attempt to shift the blind from its set position, the control system actively counteracts the disturbance to maintain its target.

### [Video 3 - Control Panel in Automatic Mode](https://github.com/Arnaudinnau/APRI0007_VLuxe/blob/main/Videos/3.mp4)
This video showcases the system operating in automatic mode. The user sets a desired indoor temperature, which is displayed on the LCD. The system automatically adjusts conditions to maintain that temperature.

### [Video 4 - Automatic Window Opening (Temperature)](https://github.com/Arnaudinnau/APRI0007_VLuxe/blob/main/Videos/4.mp4)
This video demonstrates the automatic opening of the window due to elevated indoor temperature. When the measured temperature exceeds the user-defined threshold, the window is automatically opened to regulate the environment.

### [Video 5 - Automatic Blind Closing (Luminosity)](https://github.com/Arnaudinnau/APRI0007_VLuxe/blob/main/Videos/5.mp4)
This video shows the automatic closing of the blind in response to high outdoor luminosity. The system reacts by closing the blind to reduce incoming light intensity.

### [Video 6 - Manual Control Mode](https://github.com/Arnaudinnau/APRI0007_VLuxe/blob/main/Videos/6.mp4)
This video displays the manual control mode for both the window and the blind. In this mode, the user can operate both devices independently of environmental conditions.
